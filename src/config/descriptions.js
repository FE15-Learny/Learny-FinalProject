      "content": "In software development, it is important to write code that is easy to delete and not easy to extend. This may sound counterintuitive at first, but the idea behind it is to reduce the complexity and maintenance cost of the codebase. When we see 'lines of code' as 'lines spent', we realize that by deleting unnecessary code, we are actually reducing the overall cost of maintaining the software. Instead of striving to build highly reusable software, which often introduces unnecessary complexity, it is better to focus on building disposable software that serves its purpose and can be easily replaced or removed when needed.",

      "content": "As a designer, presenting your work is an essential skill that you need to develop at every stage of your design career. Whether you are working with developers, clients, stakeholders, or showcasing your portfolio, effective presentation can greatly impact the perception and understanding of your work. One technique that can help improve the presentation of your designs is using hierarchy strips. Hierarchy strips are visual elements that indicate the importance and order of elements in a user interface. By carefully arranging and styling these strips, you can guide the viewer's attention, create visual structure, and enhance the overall user experience.",
