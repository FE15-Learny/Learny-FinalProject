    description: "In this JavaScript project, we will create an image search engine that allows users to search for any image by typing its name. The search engine will then display a list of images sourced from the stock image website Unsplash.\n\nTo build this image search engine, we will utilize the Unsplash API and leverage the power of JavaScript. With the help of JavaScript, we can interact with the API, retrieve the desired images based on user input, and showcase them in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.\n\nBy combining the flexibility of JavaScript and the vast collection of images available on Unsplash, we aim to develop a robust and efficient image search engine. Users will be able to explore and discover a wide variety of visual content simply by entering relevant keywords.",
